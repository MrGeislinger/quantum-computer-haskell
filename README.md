Haskell Implementation Of A Quantum Computer
============================================

This project is an experimental implementation of a quantum computer/circuit
using Haskell. Inspired by the bra-ket notation for quantum states, this 
project uses the notation to create quantum states of the qbits "Up" and 
"Down" binary quantum states (also represented as "|0>" and "|1>"). These 
states can then be used to build quantum circuits by using a series of qbits 
and quantum logic gates.
